# Power Method
This group project, completed for the course Numerical Methods in Calculus and Linear Algebra, explores the Power Method in detail. It covers the theoretical foundations of the algorithm, provides a Python implementation, and demonstrates how the method is used in real-world systems such as PageRank.
